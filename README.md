In this project I worked with COVID19 dataset, published by John Hopkins University, which consist of the data related to cumulative number of confirmed cases, per day, in each Country. Also I had another dataset consist of various life factors, scored by the people living in each country around the globe. I merged these two datasets to see if there is any relationship between the spread of the the virus in a country and how happy people are, living in that country. I have found a very interesting result in this analysis, this result shows that people who are living in developed countries are more prone to getting the corona virus infection as compared to less developed countries, possible reasons can be-
-Developed countries usually have older populations, and age is one of the key factors from spreading and dying from covid19. Thus, developed countries are more prone to the infection.
-As developed countries have more resources and better medical infrastructure, a much larger number of test were performed, therefore number of detected cases are higher in developed countries."
